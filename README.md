Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share my first little "festival" project at the Sisyphus Theater in Los Santos with you all. I've added a DJ stage with lighting effects. At the entrance, there's a separation: left for regular visitors and through the "Pi√üwasser" fences for access to the VIP lounge. From the lounge, there's a separate entrance to the festival stage. In the middle, there's also a tent for the organizers and a small area for VIPs. Further along, you'll find a hotdog stand and beverage carts. Down the line, there's a tattoo booth and portable toilets.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to contact me via direct message with any ideas or feedback.

Script Recommendation:
For those interested in enhancing their setup, I recommend checking out "FiveM Hall" by "Critical Scripts." It's a great tool to elevate your project even further. Check out the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZtYWaDabuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZtYWaDabuY)
